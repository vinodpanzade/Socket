#Socket.io and websocket basic to advance Notes

Difference between WebSocket and HTTP

HTTP:
A request-response protocol that requires a new connection for each data exchange. HTTP is ideal for static web pages and resources.

WebSocket:
A full-duplex protocol that maintains a continuous connection, allowing real-time, two-way communication between the client and server. WebSocket is ideal for real-time communication and applications that require frequent and persistent communication. 

Data transmission:
a=>HTTP uses half-duplex communication, where only one party can communicate at a time. 
b=>WebSocket uses full-duplex communication, where either side of the connection can send messages whenever they want

In HTTP, the client (e.g., a browser) sends a request, and the server responds. The communication happens in turns—first the client speaks, then the server replies. Only one party can communicate at a time.

Example:

Client: "Hey server, can I have the homepage?" (Request)
Server: "Sure, here is the homepage content." (Response)


In WebSocket, both the client and the server can send messages independently and simultaneously. It’s like a phone call where both people can talk and listen at the same time.

Example:

Client: "Hi server, I’m connected!"
Server: "Welcome! Here’s a real-time update for you."
Client: "Thanks! Here’s some new data from my end."


Visualization:
HTTP (Half-Duplex):
Client → Server → Client → Server

WebSocket (Full-Duplex):
Client ↔ Server (Both can send messages at the same time)


Security
Both HTTP and WebSocket support encryption, but through different protocols: 
HTTP: Uses HTTPS to secure communication and data transfer. 
WebSocket: Uses WSS (WebSocket Secure) to secure communication and data transfer



Difference between Socket.io and WebSocket:
The main difference between Socket.IO and WebSocket is that Socket.IO is a library built on top of WebSocket, adding features that simplify development

Nature:
WebSocket is a lower-level protocol that provides a basic communication channel. Socket.IO is a higher-level abstraction that simplifies implementation

Features:
Automatic Reconnection:
Socket.IO: If the connection drops, it automatically tries to reconnect.
Example: A chat app reconnects seamlessly after a network issue.
WebSocket: You must manually handle reconnection in your code.

Multiplexing:
Socket.IO: Supports multiple channels (namespaces) over one connection.
Example: Chat app with separate rooms (/sports and /tech namespaces).
WebSocket: Requires separate connections for each channel.
explain this proper

Imagine a chat app with two chat rooms: /sports and /tech. You can use namespaces in Socket.IO to handle both rooms over the same WebSocket connection:
means we want to use two route like sports and tech then we can do this with only one socket connection 
but in web socket we have to make seperate conenction for seprate route

Example
import { io } from 'socket.io-client';

// Connect to the sports namespace
const sportsSocket = io('http://localhost:8080/sports');
sportsSocket.emit('message', 'Hello, sports fans!');

// Connect to the tech namespace
const techSocket = io('http://localhost:8080/tech');
techSocket.emit('message', 'Hello, tech enthusiasts!');
const io = require('socket.io')(8080); like in websocket 8080 and 8081 we have to use make two connection

this is done in socket.io but for WebSocketwe have to use in backend 2 ports 

Ease of use:
Socket.IO is more  easier to use, especially for developers who prefer a comprehensive solution. 
Performance:
WebSocket offers superior performance and is ideal for low-latency communication.


Result:
Websocket:
